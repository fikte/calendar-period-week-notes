# calendar-period-week-notes

An Obsidian plugin that shows a calendar grid with period week numbering and a visual of when notes are created / modified. A ScratchPad note area which is saved in your vault and a notes list area to click to open recent files. Lots of configuration settings to adjust and make it your own.

## Calendar view with ScratchPad and Notes tabbed views

The calendar grid displays a month view with days and coloured dots indicating files have either been created, (green), modified, (amber), or Daily Notes created, (blue). The dot colours are configurable in the plugin settings and can be turned off if needed.
The month title font size, colour and format are also configurable in the settings.
The period week column is for all those who work for companies that use 13 periods, with 4 weeks in each period, across their financial year. The start date is configurable and rolls over for previous or next years.
