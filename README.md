# Calendar Period Week Notes

A powerful calendar and dashboard system for Obsidian, designed for deep customization and integration with your notes, tasks, and files. It combines a dynamic calendar with a configurable dashboard featuring task summaries, file creation heatmaps, and much more.

---

## ✨ Features

### 📊 The All-New Dashboard

The plugin now features a powerful, customizable dashboard grid that can be switched between two primary modes by clicking its tab. All widgets are collapsible and their order can be rearranged via drag-and-drop in the settings.

-   **Two Main Views**:
    -   **Tasks Dashboard**: Get an at-a-glance overview of your productivity.
    -   **Creation Dashboard**: Visualize your note and file creation activity over time.
-   **Tasks Dashboard Widgets**:
    -   **Task Summary Widgets**: See summaries for `Today`, `Tomorrow`, `Next 7 Days`, and `Future & No Due Date`, with progress bars showing `Incomplete`, `In-Progress`, `Completed`, and `Overdue` tasks.
    -   **Mini & Collapsed States**: Click the header to collapse a widget, or use the toggle to switch to a compact "mini" view.
    -   **Weekly/Monthly Task Metrics**: View bar charts summarizing task completion and creation over the current week and month.
-   **Creation Dashboard Widgets**:
    -   **Custom Heatmaps**: Create an unlimited number of personalized heatmap widgets to track file activity. Each heatmap is deeply configurable:
        -   **Date Source**: Track files by `creation date` or by a `date in the note title`.
        -   **Custom Filters**: Combine multiple rules (`tag`, `filename`, `path`, `filetype`) using `AND`/`OR` logic.
        -   **Date Range**: Set custom time windows using "Months Back" and "Months Forward" fields.
        -   **Color & Links**: Assign a unique color and link the widget's total count to a summary note.
        -   **Debug Mode**: A special mode to help you troubleshoot your filter rules.
    -   **All Files Heatmap**: A default widget that shows all note and asset creation activity across your vault.

### 🗓️ Dynamic Calendar View

-   **Dual Calendar Layouts**: Instantly switch between a traditional **monthly grid** and a continuous **vertical scroll** view by clicking the month title.
-   **Enhanced Mobile Experience**:
    -   **Swipe Gestures**: Intuitively swipe up on the grid to collapse it, swipe down on the header to expand it, and swipe down on the grid itself to switch to the vertical view.
    -   **Optimized Interaction**: On mobile, **long-press a date** to open the details popup and **tap the date** to open the daily note. The calendar also auto-collapses when you focus a search bar to maximize screen space.
-   **Custom Period/Week System**: Structure your year with a 13-period, 4-week system. Set your own start date for P1W1.
-   **Flexible Week Start**: Choose either Sunday or Monday as the first day of the week.
-   **At-a-Glance Dot Indicators**: See daily activity with fully customizable colored dots for daily notes, weekly notes, new/modified notes, new assets, and external calendar events.
-   **Task & Event Indicators**: Visualize your workload with multiple styles:
    -   **Badge**: A numerical count of open tasks/events.
    -   **Heatmap**: The cell background color changes based on the number of tasks/events.
    -   **Dot**: A single, customizable dot.
    -   **Custom Task Statuses**: Go beyond `[x]`. Use symbols like `/` (in-progress), `>` (forwarded), `!` (important), or `?` (questions), all with customizable icons.
-   **Advanced Highlighting**: Customize highlighting for the current week row, day column on hover, or use the **Complex** mode to highlight both the row and column up to the hovered date.
-   **Weekly Notes**: Create and manage weekly notes with customizable naming formats, template support, and a dot indicator on the week number.

**Please Note:** For the calendar event dots you may (optionally in the plugin settings) set up to fetch over the internet the calendar event information you wish to see / view on the caleandar grid and popup window.
