## Calendar view with ScratchPad and Notes tabbed views

The calendar grid displays a month view with days and coloured dots indicating files have either been created, (green), modified, (amber), or Daily Notes created, (blue). The dot colours are configurable in the plugin settings and can be turned off if needed.
The month title font size, colour and format are also configurable in the settings.
The period week column is for all those who work for companies that use 13 periods, with 4 weeks in each period, across their financial year. The start date is configurable and rolls over for previous or next years.

### Hovering over a day with notes

The dots next to the note title show if they have been created, (green), modified, (amber), or the note is a Daily Note, (blue) on that day. These colours are configurable in the plugin settgings. The exmaple below shows one file, a Daily Note, that was created for that day. 
Clicking the note title will load that note in the main view for reading or editing.

## ScratchPad Tab

The ScratchPad textarea allows for quick taking of notes which are also saved to a ScratchPad note file in your vault, meaning what you add here will be saved and sync'd across your devices. The screenshot shows the ScratchPad notes and the note in the main view with hhe rendered markdown. The location of where the ScratchPad note is saved in your vault is configuratble in the plugin settings. 
Tip: if the ScratchPad note is selected and not loaded in the main view, click the tab again and it will be loaded for viewing.
