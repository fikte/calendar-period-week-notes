# calendar-period-week-notes
Obsidian plugin that puts a calendar grid with period week numbering and visual of when notes are created / modified. A ScratchPad note area which is saved in your vault and a notes list area to click to open recent files. Lots of configuration settings to adjust and make your own style.
