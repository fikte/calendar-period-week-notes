# calendar-period-week-notes

Obsidian plugin that shows a calendar grid with period week numbering and a visual of when notes are created / modified. A ScratchPad note area which is saved in your vault and a notes list area to click to open recent files. Lots of configuration settings to adjust and make it your own style.

## Calendar view with ScratchPad and Notes tabbed options

The calendar grid displays a month view with days and coloured dots indicating files have either been created, (green), modified, (amber), or Daily Notes have been created, (blue). The dots colours are configurable in the plugin settings.
The month title colour and format are also configurable in the settings.
